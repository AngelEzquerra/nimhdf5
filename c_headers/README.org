This folder contains the HDF5 header files, which were converted using
c2nim. Some of them had to be modified for c2nim to successfully
convert them. 

The files themselves are not needed, they are here for reference in
the future, in case bugs happen due to unwarranted / breaking changes
to these header files. 

This might quite possibly be the case, due to my lack of understanding
of the HDF5 library / desire to get it working in the first place.
